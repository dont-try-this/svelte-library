# svelte-library
For our NPM Svelte UI library, we've chosen to implement a design system based on the principles of shadcn. This approach allows us to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface while maintaining flexibility and ease of use for developers.

Key features of our UI library include:

- Customizable components adhering to shadcn design principles (e.g., shadcn-svelte)
- Responsive layouts for seamless desktop and mobile experiences
- Accessibility-focused implementations
- Easy integration with existing Svelte projects
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

By leveraging the shadcn design system, we aim to provide a modern, efficient, and visually consistent UI toolkit for our development team and potential open-source contributors.
